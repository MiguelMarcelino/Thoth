# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Common Problem Types

### Arrays & Strings

* Sliding window → subarrays, max/min, substring problems
* Two pointers → sorted arrays, sums, duplicates
* Prefix sums / cumulative sums → range queries, sum checks
* Hashing → frequency counts, anagrams, two-sum variants
* Matrix problems → rotation, traversal, DP on grids

### Linked Lists

* Single / double linked list operations → reverse, detect cycles, merge
* Pointer manipulation → removing duplicates, swapping nodes

### Stacks & Queues

* Stack problems → valid parentheses, monotonic stack, histogram problems
* Queue problems → BFS, sliding window max, circular queue

### Trees & Graphs

* Binary trees / BSTs → traversal, LCA, depth, path sums
* Graphs → BFS/DFS, shortest path, connected components, topological sort
* Union-Find / Disjoint sets → connectivity, cycles

### Recursion & Backtracking

* Subsets / permutations / combinations
* Word search / maze / path-finding problems
* Constraint satisfaction problems

### Dynamic Programming

* 1D / 2D DP → fibonacci, climbing stairs, knapsack, coin change
* State machine DP → stock trading, sequences
* Tree / graph DP → path sums, independent sets

### Heap / Priority Queue

* Top-k problems, sliding window max
* Merging intervals / sorted lists

### Hash Tables & Sets

* Frequency counts, two-sum variants
* Sliding window with duplicates or unique elements
* Caching / LRU problems

### Math & Bit Manipulation

* Primes / divisors / modulo arithmetic
* XOR / AND / OR tricks
* Number manipulation / digit DP

### Design & Simulation

* LRU / LFU Cache
* Rate limiter / file system / parking lot design
* Queues, stacks, or custom data structures
