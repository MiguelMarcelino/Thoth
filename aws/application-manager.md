# Application Manager
* Application Manager helps DevOps engineers investigate and remediate issues with their AWS resources in the context of their applications and clusters. 
* An application is a logical group of AWS resources that you want to operate as a unit. 
	* Can represent different versions of an application, ownership boundaries for operators, or developer environments, to name a few.
* Support for container clusters --> Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Elastic Container Service (ECS) clusters. 
* Information is aggregated from multiple AWS services and Systems Manager capabilities to a single AWS Management Console.

## Advantages
* Application Manager reduces the time it takes for DevOps engineers to detect and investigate issues with AWS resources.
* Reduces the time it takes to remediate issues by providing runbooks that perform common remediation tasks on AWS resources.
