# NAT Traversal and Secure Connection Techniques

- NAT traversal allows devices behind NAT to establish connections using STUN, TURN, or hole punching.
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) authenticates both client and server using certificates for secure communication.
- WebSocket keep-alive maintains long-lived, bidirectional connections with periodic pings to prevent timeouts and ensure session stability.
