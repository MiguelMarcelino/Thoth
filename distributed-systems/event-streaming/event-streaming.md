# Event Streaming
- The practice of capturing data in real-time from event sources like databases, sensors, mobile devices, cloud services, and software applications in the form of streams of events
- Events streams are stored in durable storage for later retrieval
- We can react to event streams in real-time as well as retrospectively
- Ensures continuous flow and interpretation of data
- It can serve as the foundation for event-driven architectures and microservices
