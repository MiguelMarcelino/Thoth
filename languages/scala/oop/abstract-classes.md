# Abstract Classes
* When you want to write a class, but you know it will have abstract members, you can either create a trait or an abstract class. 
* There are two situations where itâ€™s better to use an abstract class than a trait:
	* You want to create a base class that takes constructor arguments
	* The code will be called from Java code
