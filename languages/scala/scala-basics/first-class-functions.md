# First-class functions
* Most features from funcitonal programming are supported
	* Lambdas
	* Higher-order functions (HOFs)
	* Immutable collections in the standard library
* Most collections support the functions `map` and `filter`, which allow for the use of lambdas
* Most collections are immutable (`List`, `Vector`, `Map`, `Set`)
	* Functions executed on these objects donâ€™t mutate the collection, but instead return a new collection with the updated data
