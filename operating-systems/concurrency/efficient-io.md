# Efficient IO (Non-blocking, epoll/kqueue)

Efficient IO refers to techniques that allow a program to handle multiple input/output operations concurrently without wasting CPU time waiting for slow operations (like disk reads or network responses). This is crucial for high-performance servers and real-time applications.

## Key Concepts

* Non-blocking IO: Instead of waiting for an operation (like reading from a socket) to complete, the program initiates the operation and continues executing other tasks. When the data is ready, the program is notified. This prevents the CPU from being idle.

* Event-driven IO: The program waits for events (like “data is ready to read”) rather than continuously checking (polling). This is more efficient because the system only reacts when necessary.

* epoll (Linux) / kqueue (BSD, macOS): These are high-performance event notification mechanisms provided by the OS. They allow programs to efficiently monitor many file descriptors (like sockets) simultaneously and get notified when they’re ready for reading or writing.

* Comparison to traditional IO: Traditional blocking IO can waste CPU time because a thread is stuck waiting for data. Non-blocking, event-driven IO lets a single thread handle thousands of connections efficiently.

## Use Cases

* High-performance web servers (like NGINX or Node.js)
* Network servers handling thousands of simultaneous connections
* Real-time applications like chat servers or trading platforms
