## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

- Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
- Working Software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

Twelve principles for Agile:
1. Satisfy customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development (Gain competitive advantage)
3. Deliver working software frequently
4. Business people and developers must work together
5. Build projects around motivated individuals
6. Convey information face-to-face
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Promote sustainable development (maintain constant pace)
9. Agility is enhanced through continuous attention to technical excellence and design
10. Simplicity is essential (maximize the work done)
11. Best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. Regularly reflect on how to become more effective and tune behaviour


Guidelines for the Agile Architect
1. Commitment and accountability of success-critical stakeholders
2. Satisfy stakeholders (meeting and acceptability threshold based on success-based negotiations and trade-offs)
3. Incremental and evolutionary growth of system definition and stakeholder commitment
4. Interactive system development and definition
5. Interleaved system development and definition (allow early discovering of core capabilities, continuous adaptation to change, â€¦)
6. Risk management (risk-driven anchor point milestones)
